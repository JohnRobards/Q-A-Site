    <h2>New Student FAQ</h2>
    <br />
	
    <p class="question">How do I decide what courses to take?</p>
    <p class="answer">What courses you wish to take are entirely up to you! Taking a mix of courses that you might already be somewhat
	familiar with and some that you've always been interested in but never had the chance to study before is usually a good idea. It is
	not necessary to declare your major until second semester sophomore year and new students are encouraged to experiment and figure
	out what it is that they want to study. If you want specific course suggestions, the best places to check are with your four year
	advisor (they're all quite lovely and would absolutely love to talk to you), your RA's, your <a href= "https://firstyear.wustl.edu/CampusResources/Pages/WUSAs.aspx">WUSAs</a>,
	and to ask anyone you may already know at the school for their suggestions.</p>
    <p class="link">For a complete list of possible courses, go here: <a href="https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/CourseListings/Semester/Listing.aspx">Courses</a></p>
	<p class="link">If you're confused about how to register or what Webstac is, go here: <a href="Washu_Tools.html">Washu Tools</a></p>
    <br />
    
    <p class="question">I took AP courses in highschool or I wish to transfer credits from another university, what do those count for?</p>
    <p class="answer">For the majority of AP courses (other than a few language courses), a score requirement of 4 or 5 is required to receive
	credit for the class. A maximum of 15 credits, through transfer or testing scores, may be counted towards your degree. If you feel you qualify,
	call 1-888-CALL-4-AP (with course code 6929) to submit your test scores. If you wish you submit another type of test score (such as the IB)
	or to transfer credits, please follow the link below to read our full policy.</p>

    <br />
    
    <p class="question">Where can I find a group of people who like to do "X" activity?</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>Clubs:</b> Clubs are always a great place to start to find people with similar interests to yours, and WashU has clubs for almost
	every type of activity a college student might be interested in. Our club topics range from political activism to a club dedicated solely
	to Texas Hold'em to almost anything else you could imagine. Go the the link below for a full list, or just wait a few weeks into the semester
	for the Club Fair, where you can go around and talk to representatives of all of these great clubs and sign up! If you're joining late into
	the semester and still want to join a club, your best bet would be to go to the link below and send any clubs that you're interested in an email
	directly or to ask your advisor/RA for club suggestions. Remember to not be afraid to sign up for a lot of clubs, they're a great way to meet
	people and you don't have to go if you don't like it after the first meeting.</p>
	<p class = "answer"><b>Club Sports:</b> If you were specifically looking for a sport that you wanted to play and meet some friends along the way,
	then the place to go would be <a href="http://bearsports.wustl.edu/intramurals/sports_clubs">here</a>. WashU's club sports offer a nice way
	to compete in a lowkey environment and meet new friends with similar interests. Don't be afraid if you're not very good either, most
	people who do club sports are just looking to have fun and meet new people. All club sports also will have teams for new students or freshman,
	so you'll be able to meet a lot of other students in a similar situation to you!</p>

    <br />
    
    <p class="question">Where can I eat on or around campus?</p>
    <p class="answer"><b>On Campus:</b> As far as dining on campus goes, there are a variety of places to eat, including Bear's Den,
	The DUC, Ibby's, Stanley's, Subway, The Village and a variety of coffee/snack locations spread around campus. For a breakdown of these places and
	their offerings in detail, please go to the page linked below. All of these locations accept meal points, which every student at WashU
	has as part of their meal plan, so all students have easy access to food and don't need to carry cash or credit cards around.</p>
	<p class="answer"><b>Off Campus:</b> As for dining off campus, that really depends on how far you're willing to walk/ride the metro or if you
	know someone with access to a car (unlikely if you're a freshman or any new student coming in). The <a href="http://visittheloop.com/explore/?post-cat=food-drink">loop</a> 
	is within walking distance and has a lot of food options if you get bored of the stuff on campus. As for other places, <a href="http://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g44881-Saint_Louis_Missouri.html">this</a>
	is a pretty good list of some of the best places around St. Louis to get you started. If you want any further suggestions, the best way to
	find out is to ask upperclassmen or your advisor where they like to eat around St. Louis. The metro is safe and it's easy to get to a variety
	of places using it.</p>

    <p class="question">How do I make friends?</p>		
    <p class="answer">Clubs are a great way to meet people, refer back to the question above for more details on that. Other than that, just try talking
	to people. Go up to people on your floor and ask what their interests are, or what classes they're taking and see if you have any common interests.
	Most new students are just as scared as you are, so don't worry about freaking them out. Or if you have time before one of your classes start
	strike up a conversation with the person sitting next to you instead of playing around on your phone. We at WashU strive to make all of our
	students feel at home, so if you're having any issues please let us know right away at the first year center, where our goal is to make
	sure every new student is happy.</p>
	<p class="link">If you're having issues meeting people with similar interests: <a href="https://firstyear.wustl.edu/Pages/home.aspx">Contact Us</a></p>
    <br />
	
    <p class="question">I'm transfering from another university, what is different here than at my old school?</p>
    <p class="answer">That really depends on what school you went to before. If you want an in depth answer, then contact us below and let us know
	what school you attended previously, otherwise you can go <a href="https://wustl.edu/about/compliance-policies/">here</a> for a full list of WashU's policies.</p>
