	<p class="question">Webstac</p>
	<p class="answer"><a href="https://acadinfo.wustl.edu/WSHome/Default.aspx">Webstac</a> is where you can view your grades, register/drop courses, see
	your meal plan balance, and declare a major. You'll be using it a lot in the next 4 years to keep track of how you're doing.</p>
    <br />

	<p class="question">Blackboard</p>
	<p class="answer"><a href="https://bb.wustl.edu/webapps/login/">Blackboard</a> is where some of your classes will choose to use to
	post online assignment and keep track of individual grades on projects. Not all classes will use blackboard, but for those that do, you'll need to
	know how to use it, they won't show you.</p>
    <br />
	
	<p class="question">Meal Plan</p>
	<p class="answer">Your meal plan at WashU is how much you have to spend on food for the two semester. Meal Points don't carry over from year to year, but
	they do carry over in between semesters. Keep track of how much you have left on Webstac and you're able to buy more or use real money if you do happen to run
	out. The silver plan is usually sufficient for new students living on campus, but if you eat a lot you might want to get the gold plan. You pay
	using your student ID, just like you would with a credit card.</p>
    <br />
   
    <p class="question">Student ID/Room Key</p>
	<p class="answer">Do not lose these, or you will have to pay a fine, they allow you to pay for meals/get into buildings and get into your room respectively.
	Your student ID also has a unique six-digit code that represents your student ID code, you'll be asked to provide this code on exams and from time
	to time, so it's a good idea to memorize it.</p>
    <br />
	
	<p class="question">Metro Passes</p>
	<p class="answer">As a WashU student, you have access to a metro pass for unlimited free use of the St. Louis Metro.
	<a href="http://parking.wustl.edu/transportation/Pages/u-pass.aspx">This page</a> will walk you through how to get one.</p>
